\subsubsection{\tt buildv}
\label{benchmarkbuildv}

{\tt buildv} is an AKS version of a synthetic benchmark that constructs integer
vectors by successive catenation operations, {\em i.e.}:

 {\apl (1e6+\qiota\00),(1e6+\qiota\01),(1e6+\qiota\02),\dots,(1e6+\qiota\0n-1)}

\noindent It is primarily intended to measure the
performance of storage allocation/deallocation and
copying operations. The addition operations are
intended to force the result type to 32-bit integers.

Since all versions of these tests are likely to be dominated
by storage-subsystem operations, we expect to see little
difference between the \dapl and \sac versions of them,
except for APL interpreter overhead.

The benchmarks {\tt buildv}, {\tt buildvAKD}, {\tt buildv2}, {\tt buildv2AKD},
{\tt buildvf}, and {\tt buildvfAKD} form a clique, as they
all perform similar tasks.
