These benchmarks are mostly useful for comparing the performance
of APEX-generated code against that of interpreted APL.

To compile these benchmarks:

   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make -j

To execute these benchmarks:

Sequential:

   make test-seq

Multi-thread, using pthreads:

   make test-mt_pth
