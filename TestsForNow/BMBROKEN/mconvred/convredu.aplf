 r←fi convredu tr
⍝ convredu performs standard convolution w/window reduce
⍝ fi is the filter/wavelet vector (usually shorter than tr)
⍝ tr is the seis trace or other vector to be filtered
⍝ Output r is a vector, the filtered/convolved trace
⍝ NO APEX extensions, please     ⍣
 r←(⍴fi)f/tr,(¯1+⍴fi)⍴0
