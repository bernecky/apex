\subsubsection{\tt ipdd}
\label{benchmarkipdd}

{\tt ipdd} is a synthetic AKS benchmark that performs
a double-double ({\apl D\qplus\qdot\qtimes\qtran\0D}) matrix product on 
arrays of shape {\tt [500, 500]}. This is the classic
{\em matmul} of linear algebra.

We expect that \wlf and \awlf should exhibit similar performance
behavior on this benchmark.
