\subsubsection{\tt ipplusand}
\label{benchmarkiplusand}

{\tt ipplusand} is a synthetic AKS benchmark that performs
a Boolean-Boolean ({\apl B\qplus\qdot\qand\qtran\0B}) matrix product on 
arrays of shape {\tt [ 800, 800]}.

We expect that \wlf and \awlf should exhibit similar performance
on this benchmark.
