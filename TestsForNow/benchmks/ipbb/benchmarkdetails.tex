This benchmark performs an AKS Boolean-Boolean matrix 
product ({\tt B1\qor\qdot\qand\0B2}),
such as might be used as a step in finding the transitive closure of
a graph, operating on Boolean arrays of shape {\tt [400, 400]}. 

The algorithm used is Bernecky's generalization of
the CDC STAR matrix product algorithm,
which interchanges loop ordering so that each element
of the left argument is fetched only once, and is
applied, scalar-vector, against a row of the right argument,
then vector-vector reduced into the result.~\cite{RBernecky:apex}

This algorithm offers several opportunities for optimizations.
First, any type coercion of the left argument (absent in this
case but, for example, present in a Boolean-Double matrix 
product) occurs only once per element. Second, the left
argument can be considered sparse, as a zero 
contributes nothing to the result, in which case both of the computations
above can be ignored. Third, a one is an identity on the 
scalar-vector computation, so that can be elided.
Finally, the presence of vector-based, stride-1 computations
permits exploitation of vector and parallel hardware.
