% Fragment header field definitions:

% z = x jsymbol y
%         jsymbol xyz-ranks lefttypes righttypes resulttypes specialcasename, if any
%         1       2         3         4          5           6 
% e.g.,
%Fragment sl      101       bid       bidc       bidc        ONEEL
%Fragment sl      101       bid       bidc       bidc        .

For each set of fragments in a file, xxx.frg, we choose the first fragment
that meets all criteria. Hence, special case code fragments must precede generic
code. In the above example from replicate.frg, the first fragment
generates code for, e.g., (,x)/y, which has been marked as "ONEEL",
because it handles the non-scalar singleton case. 

If the fragment order had been reversed, the generic code for, e.g., (x1,x2)/y
would be generated.
