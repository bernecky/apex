Root namespace for the apex compiler.

Usage:
  OptionList apex src

OptionList is a blank-delimited text vector of zero
or more compiler options, in the form X=Y.
E.g.,

 'targetlanguage=sac debugdfa=1' apex 'TestsForNow/ipbb'

The first option makes the compiler generate SaC code.
Plural code could be generated with 'targetlanguage=plural'.

The second option makes the compiler emit debug information 
during its data flow analysis (dfa) phase. 

src is a relative path to the folder containing
the APL source code to be compiled, as a set of
.dyalog functions, whose names appear, one per line,
in the file blist.cu in that folder.

E.g., blist.cu is:

ipbb.ufn
main.ufn
