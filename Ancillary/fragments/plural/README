Design rules:

a. All arguments are read-only. No update-in-place allowed.
   Hence, no indexed assign, take/drop, or other manipulation of
   function arguments.

   Be wary of array slices.

b. Use .dup if you to copy an argument.

c. I have no idea how to deal efficiently with array results from
   sub-functions. E.g., consider:  3↑"1 ( 5 6⍴'abcd')

   We want to use vector take, with the rank conjunction wrapped
   it.
