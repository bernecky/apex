As we expected, the \awlf version of this benchmark executes
somewhat faster (26\%) than the \wlf version. Instruction counts,
both scalar and vector, track that speedup. The large matrix
sizes involved ({\tt 2400x2400x5}) result in fairly high
data cache miss rates for both optimizations, but \awlf
outperforms \wlf about 60\% better in that regard, due to
\fixme{Fewer WL?}.
