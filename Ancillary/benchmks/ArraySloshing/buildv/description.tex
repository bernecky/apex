\subsubsection{\tt buildv}
\label{benchmarkbuildv}

{\tt buildv} is an AKS version of a synthetic benchmark that constructs integer
vectors by successive catenation operations, {\em i.e.}:

 {\apl (1e6+\qiota\00),(1e6+\qiota\01),(1e6+\qiota\02),\dots,(1e6+\qiota\0n-1)}

\noindent It is primarily intended to measure the
performance of storage allocation/deallocation and
copying operations. Addition operations are
used to force the result type to 32-bit integers, to keep Dyalog APL
from using 16-bit integers.

We expect that all versions of these tests are likely to be dominated
by storage-subsystem operations, so expect little
difference in performance between the \dapl and \sac versions of them,
except for APL interpreter overhead.

The benchmarks {\tt buildv}, {\tt buildvAKD}, {\tt buildv2}, {\tt buildv2AKD},
{\tt buildvf}, and {\tt buildvfAKD} form a clique, as they
all perform similar tasks.
