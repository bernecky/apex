\subsubsection{\tt ipbb}
\label{benchmarkipbb}

{\tt ipbb} is a synthetic AKS benchmark that performs
a Boolean-Boolean ({\apl M\qor\qdot\qand\qtran\0M}) matrix product on 
arrays of shape {\tt [400, 400]}.

The \sac implementation of these benchmarks utilizes Bernecky's
generalization of the CDC STAR APL matrix 
product algorithm.~\cite{RBernecky:apex}

The benchmarks {\tt ipbb}, {\tt ipbbAKD}, {\tt ipape}, {\tt ipapeAKD},
{\tt ipopne}, {\tt ipopneAKD}, {\tt ipbd}, {\tt ipbdAKD}, {\tt ipdd},
{\tt ipddAKD}, {\tt ipplusand}, {\tt ipplusandAKD},
form a clique, as they all perform similar tasks.
