 r←main;a;b;c;d;e
⍝ Unit test for Shape Cliques
 a←⍳5
 b←a            ⍝ a,b in same clique
 c←a+b          ⍝ a,b,c in same clique. Clique detected
⍝ Guarded shape clique
 d←a+2+⍳5       ⍝ Conform check needed. Set guard
 e←d+a          ⍝ e,d,a in same clique, guarded by d computation
 r←2 5 8 11 14≡e
 ⎕←r←r,a≡a-1|a    ⍝ Should be in same clique, but nmo fails to catch it
 ⎕←r←1-∧/r
