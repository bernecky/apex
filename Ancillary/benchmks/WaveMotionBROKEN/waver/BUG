github/bernecky/apex issue #5: apex fails to generate correct matmul() code for Wave Motion benchmark

As of 2021-06-28:

Dyalog APL v.40273 takes 1565msec

sac2c waver.unittest.sac takes 3830msec

sac2c -doawlf waver.unittest.sac takes 4700msec

HOWEVER, apex generated generic TRANSPOSE
code for the matmul in waver.sac, which would explain it
all.

Except for why -doawlf is even slower...

The APEX STAR code turns out to support only
rank-2 arrays, which is why it ends up generating
TRANSPOSE. 

The correct fix is to generalize the STAR code to
make it work on higher rank arrays. The fallback algorithm
should also use STAR, but without rbe's identity case.

We should also do timings to see if the TRANSPOSE case is of benefit
anywhere today.
