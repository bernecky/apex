\subsubsection{\tt iotan}
\label{benchmarkiotan}

{\tt iotan} is a synthetic AKS benchmark that computes the sum
of a double-precision vector. It is primarily intended as a very
simple test of \wlf and \awlf.

Our expectation is that the three with-loops that comprise the
benchmark should be folded into a single one by \wlf and by \awlf.
