These tests are intended to measure how well
interpreters and compilers handle arrays
that grow in size through accretion (catenate).

The buildv/realloc.sac code uses a fold with-loop
to perform the catenation, essentially with catenate-reduce.

I saw, in the dim past, linux realloc() being used
to avoid copying much of the growing result array.
Private heaps in both Dyalog APL and APEX/SaC probably
make this difficult, at best.
