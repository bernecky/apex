\subsubsection{\tt buildvfAKD}
\label{benchmarkbuildvfAKD}

{\tt buildvfAKD} is an AKD version of a synthetic benchmark that constructs 
double-precision vectors by successive catenation operations, {\em i.e.}:

 {\apl (1.5+\qiota\00),(1.5+\qiota\01),(1.5+\qiota\02),\dots,(1.5+\qiota\0n-1)}

\noindent It is primarily intended to measure the
performance of storage allocation/deallocation and
copying operations. The addition operations are
intended to force the result type to floating point.

Since all versions of these tests are likely to be dominated
by storage-subsystem operations, we expect to see little
difference between the \dapl and \sac versions of them,
except for APL interpreter overhead.

The benchmarks {\tt buildv}, {\tt buildvAKD}, {\tt buildv2}, {\tt buildv2AKD},
{\tt buildvf}, and {\tt buildvfAKD} form a clique, as they
all perform similar tasks.
