\subsubsection{\tt buildv2AKD}
\label{benchmarkbuildv2akd}

{\tt buildv2AKD} is an AKD version of a synthetic benchmark 
that constructs integer
vectors in a manner similar to that of {\tt buildvAKD}, except that
this version preallocates its result, then fills it using indexed
assignment. Because it does not have to perform repeated copies
of the already-generated result elements, we expect that it should
run significantly faster than {\tt buildvAKD}.

The benchmark is primarily intended to measure the
performance of storage allocation/deallocation and
copying operations. The addition operations are
intended to force the result type to 32-bit integers.

Since all versions of these tests are likely to be dominated
by storage-subsystem operations, we expect to see little
difference between the \dapl and \sac versions of them,
except for APL interpreter overhead.

The benchmarks {\tt buildv}, {\tt buildvAKD}, {\tt buildv2}, {\tt buildv2AKD},
{\tt buildvf}, and {\tt buildvfAKD} form a clique, as they
all perform similar tasks.
