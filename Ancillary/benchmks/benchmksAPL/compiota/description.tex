\subsubsection{\tt compiota}
\label{benchmarkcompiota}

This AKS synthetic benchmark measures the performance of the
APL { \em compress-iota} idiom, {\tt booleanVector\qslash\qiota\0N}
against compiled versions of the same expression.
This idiom appears frequently in application code, as a
way to compute a subset of the indices of a vector.
For example, tab characters in a text vector might be
changed to blanks by a statement such as:

{\tt txt\qlbr (txt\qeps\0TAB)\qslash\qiota\qrho\0txt\qrbr\qlarrow'\qblank'}

Most APL interpreters special-case this idiom because of its
frequency of appearance in application code and the potential
for significant savings of CPU time and memory, by not having
to materialize the result of {\tt \qiota\qrho\0txt}. We expect
that compiled code, with decent optimizations, should be able
to match or out-perform the APL code.

The benchmarks {\tt compiota}, {\tt compiotaAKD}, {\tt compiotad}, and
{\tt compiotadAKD} form a clique, as they
all perform similar tasks.
