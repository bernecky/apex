\subsubsection{\tt ipopne}
\label{benchmarkipopne}

{\tt ipopne} is a synthetic AKS benchmark that performs
a character-character matrix product({\apl M\qor\qdot\qne\qtran\0M}), 
on arrays of shape {\tt [ 2000, 2000]}. 

This benchmark is essentially a variant of the {\tt ipape} benchmark,
so they should both exhibit similar performance characteristics.

We expect \wlf and \awlf to perform equally well on this
benchmark.
