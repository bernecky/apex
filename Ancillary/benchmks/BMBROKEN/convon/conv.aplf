 r←wz conv tr;npad;h;n
⍝ Conv performs standard convolution
⍝ wz is the filter/wavelet vector (usually shorter than tr)
⍝ tr is the seis trace or other vector to be filtered
⍝ conv uses reshape and matrix/vector multiplication.
⍝ Output r is a vector, the filtered/convolved trace.
 h←tr,(¯1+n←⍴wz)⍴0
 r←(⍴tr)↑wz+.×(⍳n)⌽(n,⍴h)⍴h
