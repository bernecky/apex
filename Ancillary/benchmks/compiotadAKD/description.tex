\subsubsection{\tt compiotadAKD}
\label{benchmarkcompiotadakd}

This AKD synthetic benchmark measures the performance of the
APL {\em compress-iota} idiom, {\tt booleanVector\qslash\0\qomega},
where {\tt \qomega} is a double-precision vector,
against compiled versions of the same expression.

Since APL interpreters are generally unable to
detect and special-case this sort of expression, but the \sac compiler 
should be able to optimize it with no added effort, suggests that
that compiled \sac code should match or outperform the APL code,
due to the benefits of \awlf, but the \wlf version will
likely perform poorly by comparison.

The benchmarks {\tt compiota}, {\tt compiotaAKD}, {\tt compiotad}, and
{\tt compiotadAKD} form a clique, as they
all perform similar tasks.
