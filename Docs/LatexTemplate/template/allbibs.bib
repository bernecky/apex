KEYWORDS="management information systems",
PAGES="65--78",
ABSTRACT="Until recently, most Management Information Systems were 
outgrowths of previously designed data storage and retrieval systems.
As these systems were expanded, first into data banks, and then into 
information systems, the same programming language was frequently retained 
as was found in the original programming system, usually COBOL. The advent 
of on-line inquiry was slow to take hold because of the expense of coding 
and running the program, although some satisfactory systems were developed 
using PL/I. This paper discusses the use of APL as an information/decision 
system language, in the light of a computerized corporate simulation model 
used as a research tool by the authors. Conclusions specific to the research 
are examined as well as the suitability of APL as applied to these types of 
systems in general.",

PUBLISHER="Coast Community College District",

KEYWORDS="combinatorics, random, knock-out tournaments, tournaments",
PAGES="185--200",
ABSTRACT="In two recent papers, Narayana and Zidek have studied the 
combinatorics of random knock-out tournaments and investigated some of the 
natural statistical inference problems associated with tournaments. These 
tournaments involve opponents of equal strength--the case of a single 
outlier. The programming language APL, developed by Iverson, permits us to 
study knock-out tournaments without repitition systematically and provides 
explicit numerical results with the aid of a computer. Simulation, using 
APL, also permits us to compare repeated knock-outs with repeated 
round-robins using the methods suggested by David and the results of 
Narayana and Zidek. We should like to emphasize that the simulations 
represent very much a pilot and preliminary effort and were undertaken 
partly as an exercise to study the capabilities of random number generation 
in APL, and partly as a guide to further simulation involving the more 
refined ideas of tournament design. Indeed, this package only covers the 
basis of most of the results and conjectures in the first two authors' M.Sc. 
theses; we may hope that it represents a first step in the difficult choice 
of a suitable design for paired comparisons in general.",

ABSTRACT="This paper describes the development of an interactive marketing

major, multi-national manufacturing firm. As it stands at the moment, the
system has approximately 27-million bytes of data in online storage and is 
accessed in the order of 2000 times per month from five cities across 
Canada. There is a discussion of the database problems and opportunities
facing the company, and its efforts to improve their information-processing
abilities over the years. The shortcomings of COBOL-oriented batch 
processing methods and FORTRAN languages are briefly described. The steps in 
designing the APL system and making it operational are presented ,as well as 
a non-technical description of the key attributes of the system itself.
The major point made by the paper is the impact of such an interactive 
system on the management process, and how such an impact was demonstratably
made more effectively through using the APL notation than had been possible 
through any of the other approaches that the company had tried.",

glass 'tablet' and then touching the desired points of the curve with a pen 
that emits a spark. The time delay for the sound to reach the edges of the 
glass tablet is converted to x - y coordinates and transmitted to the APL 
host computer. APL functions convert this raw data into the coordinate 
system of the user's curve. Examples of the use of this facility are 
given.",

ABSTRACT="This paper describes some of the features of the alpha fast 
formatting operator used by Proprietary Computer Systems and The Computer 
Company for formatting APL data. The alpha operator accepts both numeric and 
picture type format specifications and returns a character array containing 
the results of the formatting operation. The alpha formatting operator is 
widely used in programs and to control printing formats in the immediate
execution mode. It has been in use for over two years and has been well 
accepted by PCS and TCC APL users.",

paper describes the PCS/APL Remote Job Entry (RJE) program used to drive the 
New Mexico State APL/HASP interface. APL users are provided facilities for 
creating and storing source programs in a variety of programming languages. 
Programs may be submitted from APL to the operating system. Status 
information and program results may be retrieved and printed at the APL 
terminal. Program results may also be routed to the high speed printer at 
the computer center.",

ABSTRACT="This paper is a tutorial devote to describing how to use some of 
the tools that APL can provide in the field of combinatorics. Emphasis will 
be on enumerative combinatorics. Some of the topics covere are: enumeration 
of basic combinatorial configurations, such as permutations and combinations 
with the use of APL; use of combinations to solve typical combinatorial 
problems such as certain Diophantine equations; use of recursive APL 
functions to generate certain combinatorial configurations, such as 
partitions and compositions of integers, ways to change a dollar, etc.;
the use of the encode function to generate configurations of objects with 
given properties.",

BOOKTITLE=c74,
PUBLISHER="Coast Community College District",
ORGANIZATION="Coast Community College District",
KEYWORDS="",
PAGES="281--286",
ABSTRACT="Interpolation is the fundamental numerical technique used for 
approximating the operations of the calculus. Polynomial interpolation is 
the most often use form of interpolation. The past twenty five years have 
seen the development of {\em spline interpolation}. Spline interpolation 
theory has become synonomous with many aspects of numerical analysis. The 
question is 'Why'? It has not been generally recognized that polynomial 
interpolation has many defects when used to represent physical data. 
Polynomials are beautiful examples of analytic functions. This implies 
that their local behavior determines their global behavior. Anyone dealing 
with real world phenomena can tell you that phase changes, resonance 
properties, modal systems, etc., have precisely the opposite behavior. 
The simplest form of a spline is a collection of polynomials patched 
together so as to be smooth. The 'best approximation' property of splines is 
responsible for their leading role in numerical analysis. This paper will 
provide a very brief introduction to particular cubic splines. It will also 
describe a package which has been developed on the Scientific Time Sharing 
Corporation's APL PLUS system. The areas of application to be discussed 
include mathmatics, statistics, engineering, and finance.",

ABSTRACT="We propose a modern software strategy based upon an
unorthodox use of APL, permitting adaptation of our system both
upwards (new applications) and downwards (new processors).  The tactic
is the exploitation of APL {\em not as a programming language} but as
a language for a macrogenerator.  The purpose of this paper is
twofold: first it explains to APL programmers how they can use this
language to write assemblers, compilers in a very simple and plesant
manner; second it explains to mini- and microprocessor users that APL
is surprisingly a sophisticated but cheap solution to their various
software-engineering problems",

ABSTRACT="The interpretation time of APL instructions significantly
influences the total execution time and therefore must be considered
during the development of APL programs. As an example of the tradeoff
between interpretation and execution time, the redesign process
of a hydraulic network solver originally intended for implementation in 
FORTRAN is described. Efficiency is gained by designing algorithms 
which have a more parallel nature and by extensive use of precomputations.
It is shown that evaluating an algorithm using the classical method of
counting the number ``basic steps'' is insufficient in an APL context.",

AUTHOR="Rodney W. Johnson",
PAGES="24--30",
BOOKTITLE="APL79 Conference Proceedings",
JOURNAL="ACM SIGAPL Quote Quad",
MONTH=jun,
ABSTRACT="The principle of maximum entropy and a generalization,
the principle of minimum cross entropy, are prescriptions for solving 
problems of the following sort, which are encountered in a remarkable
number of different fields. Namely, some systems may be any one of 
a given set of states; the probabilities its being in the various
states are not specified, but information about the probability
distribution is available in the form of expectation values of given
functions on the set of states. It is required to assign an optimal,
or minimally prejudiced, set of state probabilities consistent with the
given information. This paper describes the principles and presents APL
functions that use the Newton-Raphson method to compute maximum-entropy and
minimum-cross-entropy probability distributions for arbitrary sets
of given expectation values. Example calculations are given.",

ABSTRACT="This system describes an interactive system written in APL 
designed to diagnose focal lesions of the brain. It uses essentially the
same method we teach to medical students. First, a patient's signs
and symptoms are mapped onto a visual, three-dimensional representation
of the brain. Then the selection of the correct diagnosis from the 
resulting large number of possible sites is obtained by choosing the
intersection of the various pathways. The input to the model is a list
of signs and symptoms. The output is a drawing of the brain with the 
resultant lesion indicated by cross-hatching.",

@ARTICLE{GMebus:laminar,
TITLE="Laminar Extension: An Overlooked Capability and the Search for its 
Proper Home",
AUTHOR="George Mebus",
PAGES="36--41",
BOOKTITLE="APL79 Conference Proceedings",
JOURNAL="ACM SIGAPL Quote Quad",
MONTH=jun,
ABSTRACT="Scalar extension is an implicit conceptual replication of a 
single-element argument so that it matches the shape of another.
Laminar extension is a related extension of an arbitrary array, formed by 
repeating layers (or laminae) of the array along a new coordinate or
along an existing coordinate with a dimension of 1. A restricted form
of laminar extension already exists in APL as an implicit conceptual 
process. This paper identifies needs for an explicit laminar extension, and 
shows that no adequate implementation is now available in APL. By examining
existing primitives, the paper establishes one of them as the natural home 
for a primitive implementation of explicit laminar extension. Examples
illustrate its utility, and an appendix discusses its relationship to the
by-slice operator recently proposed by Jenkins and Michel.",

@ARTICLE{EEMcDonnell:fuzzyresidue,
TITLE="Fuzzy Residue",
AUTHOR="Eugene McDonnell",
PAGES="42--46",
BOOKTITLE="APL79 Conference Proceedings",
JOURNAL="ACM SIGAPL Quote Quad",
MONTH=jun,
ABSTRACT="Certain pairs of arguments to the residue function, as 
implemented on many APL systems, give results which make it seem as if
the ordinary decimal relationships we remember from grade school no longer 
hold. As far as we can tell, it looks as if a given modulus should
divide the right argument, but the implementation tells us it doesn't.
A definition for a fuzzed residue function is proposed which resolves the
difficulties users have complained of. However, certain points of continuing 
difficulty remain, where the limitations of machine arithmetic continue to
defeat the attempt to model the real number system. The representation 
function is defined in terms of the residue function, and so is affected
by the change in residue. The natuer of this effect is also described in 
this paper.",

ABSTRACT="Many people have suggested that APL be extended to complex

an implemented extension to the complex domain would be of value to
scientists, engineers, and educators, who use complex numbers in their

TITLE="Relational Data-Base Mangagement and {APL}",
AUTHOR="E.F. Codd",
PAGES="54--54",
BOOKTITLE="APL79 Conference Proceedings",
JOURNAL="ACM SIGAPL Quote Quad",
MONTH=jun,
ABSTRACT="Historically, the development of programming languages
was driven by a desire to remove needless machine-oriented
representation clutter from the programmer's purview.  When compared
with other implemented programming languages, APL goes quite far in
this direction.  However, like its competitors, APL provides almost no
support for programs that have to access and possibly update data from
shared data bases.  Such data is usually subject to syntactic and
semantic constraints that are declared on a community basis.
Moreover, both the data and constraints are subject to dynamic sharing
with other independently-developed programs.

We outline the principles underlying the relational model for
formatted data bases, including the structures, algebraic operators,
normalization, and formal data sublanguages.  We conclude with a
discussion of the need for a knowledge base (1) to act as a defining
base for a proposed data base; (2) to bediate queries and
transactions; and (3) to aid in the query formulation in formal or
natural language.

A short list of references is given for those wishing more
introductory information about relational database management.",

@ARTICLE{TMore:arraymodel,
TITLE="The Nested Rectangular Arrays as a Model of Data",
AUTHOR="Trenchard More",
PAGES="55--73",
BOOKTITLE="APL79 Conference Proceedings",
JOURNAL="ACM SIGAPL Quote Quad",
MONTH=jun,
ABSTRACT="Data, like electricity and gravity, are part of the world
in which we live.  Some occur naturally, as in the genetic code, while
most occur as a consequence of language and social organization.  The
search for a theory of data, which begins with the choice of the
model, is as important and interesting as the development of theories
in physics, economics, and psychology.

Most models of data are collections, such as the unnested array of
APL, the one-axis nested list of LISP, and the set, which is nested but
lacks the properties of order, repetitions, type, and multiple axes
inherent in rectangular arrangement.  Nested rectangular arrays have
all these properties.  the existence of simple, universally valid
equations in both set theory and linear algebra suggests that equally
simple equations may hold for all arrays.  The principles of nested
collections developed in set theory apply with few changes to the
nesting of arrays.  A one-sorted theory of arrays, in which type is

ABSTRACT="In many instances where a large amount of data
is to be manipulated, an APL interpreter is much less efficient than a 
compiled program. Also there are some tasks which are difficult to achieve
with a conventional APL system such as the control of special-purpose 
peripherals. A system is described in which an APL interpreter is used to 
control a low-level processor. The advantage of this symbiosis is that the 
user has available the high-level interactive APL with which to develop 
programs plus the higher execution speed or extended capabilities of the
low-level processor. The general problem of linking an APL interpreter with 
other processes and several levels of communication are considered. At the 
highest level, expressions in an APL-like syntax are passed between two
processors. This system was developed for the PDP-11 computer running the 
UNIX operating system. Arbitrary structures may be created by this scheme 
which is simpler to implement than variables.",

natural extension of the index-generator function shows how an array
of any valence (rank), depth of nesting, or type can be used as a
measure.  The method of generalizing shapes to measures also
generalizes addresses and paths to arbitrary arrays.  Only the leaves
of a measure, address, or path matter, the nested rectangular array
structure does not.  These results of array theory for floating arrays
are motivated by similar considerations for grounded arrays.",

polynomial operations of filter synthesis such as polynomial division,
zero shifting, and remocal of a known factor lead to interesting and

ABSTRACT="Presenting the user of an application system with a menu of 
choices is a valuable approach to the human interface problem. In a complex 
system this may take the form of a tree of menus that is presented. This 
tree of menus can also be used as the basis for a top-down development of 
the application system. This paper describes a programming system which can 
be used to acquire the tree of menus and structure the development of a
menu-driven application system in a top-down environment.

Objects called augmented menus contain not only the textual representation 
of the choices presented to the user (in three forms), but also the action 
to be taken for each choice. A menu-manager program accesses the choices and
executes the selected action. This function eliminates much of the work of 
the application developer. 

This development system is illustrated with three applications: an 
information storage and retrieval system, a class-roll record-keeping system 
and a text-editing system.",

ABSTRACT="The full-screen manager for APL allows AP writers to take 
advantage of the facilities available on a display terminal. It allows the 
user to defined fields anywhere on the screen for input or output, make 
them sensitive to the light pen, alter the intensity of the display, sound 
the audible alarm, make use of program-function keys and accept 
magnetic-badge reader input. What difference do they make to APL and the APL 
user? Do they enable the application programmer to produce better 
applications? Are they sufficiently easy to use for the problem solver?

The new facilities are described in terms of what they do and no attempt is 
made to explain the mechanics of how they work. Examples of useful functions
are given together with their APL code. This paper describes the use of 
local or remote 3270-compatible screens operating with IBM's VSAPL.
Through the use of utility function, device-dependent coding has been
avoided. Users of, for example, the IBM 5110 or other manufacturers' 
graphic displays will use similar routines provided with their devices or 
can write the functions using appropriate terminology, such as `bell' for
audible alarm, or `cross hairs' for cursor.",

TITLE="An Overlaying Method for the Effective Organization of {APL} 
Systems",
AUTHOR="A.D. Crossley and G.R. Streeter",
PAGES="294--301",
BOOKTITLE="APL79 Conference Proceedings",
JOURNAL="ACM SIGAPL Quote Quad",
MONTH=jun,
ABSTRACT="A system has been developed to manage the workspace with an 
application operating under its control. The system, known as PROGRAMSYSTEM, 
utilizes a novel overlaying technique to limit workspace contents to those 
which are pertinent to the current processing task. 

Having been evolved over the past two years, it is currently managing three 
large operational applications in different organizations, using SHARP APL
and Xerox APL. 

The paper briefly reviews some popular workspace-management methods using 
program files, and introduces the concept of SHARP APL `packages' on which 
PROGRAMSYSTEM was based. A characteristic of conventional methods is the use 
of a directory reference table to locate required objects on the program 
file. PROGRAMSYSTEM dispenses with this relatively expensive approach.
Instead, small functions are generated for the application, which 
directly references overlays on a program file; by localizing overlay 
contents within these functions, they are automatically removed from the
workspace on termination.

The methodology is explained in detail, and demonstrated by example. The 
structure of the program file is described, including the additional 
facilitiies supported by PROGRAMSYSTEM, these being: collection of cost 
statistics, handling of graphics and terminal characteristics, and extensive 
automatic documenting capabilities.",

ABSTRACT="The roles of {\apl \qrotate}, {\apl \qrot1}, and {\apl qtran}
in describing the symmetries of the square are investigated. This leads to 
relationships between the results of these functions and the cyclic and
dihedral groups of orders 2 and 4. Numerical modelling of these groups is 
accomplished through the primitives {\apl \qutack} and {\ap qdtack},
which are thus seen to play an important auxiliary role. Next the behavior 
of the functions {\apl \qugrade} and {\apl \qdgrade} applied to permutation 
vectors is investigated, and parallels are observed between these primitives 
and the primitives {\apl \qrotate}, {\apl \qrot1}, and {\apl qtran}.
These similarities are heightened by considering the partitioning of all 
permutations of a given order according to their internal symmetries.",

This is the first topic in a series of experimental cirriculum units 
currently being developed at the University of Massachusetts. 

In this paper, recursive APL functions are used to demonstrate fundamental 
search procedures, namely: Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search,
Random Search, Heuristic Search. 

For illustration, a simplified Water Jug Problem is used with a state-space
representation. The read is invited to consider programming enhancements 
as well as extensions to other problems. 

In closing, we cite some other topics potentially suitable for teaching with 
APL and mention implications for computer science education.",

BOOKTITLE="APL79 Conference Proceedings",
JOURNAL="ACM SIGAPL Quote Quad",
MONTH=jun,
ABSTRACT="Compilation of APL programs could yield a dramatic improvement in 
performance for some kinds of programs, provided that the compiler could
simplify the processing to the actual requirements of the particular 
algorithm. Other optimization approaches have been unable to achieve the
performance improvements that seem to be possible. Compilation aided by 
declarations has been demonstrated, but it is undesirable to require 
declarations if most of the information they contain can be deduced by 
inspection of the program. Certain changes and restrictions to the language
would make such deduction feasible by simplifying the analysis of control 
flow and removing apparent interfaces among programs that are not actually
used as interfaces. Some of the proposed language changes are regarded as 
improvements because they facilitate deductions about programs humans and 
therefore contribute to program readability and reliability. The other 
restrictions are inconvenient when debugging a program, but the impact is 
minimal because compilation of APL would be appropriate mainly for 
production programs that already have been tested.",

AUTHOR="Richard H. Lathwell",
PAGES="329--332",
BOOKTITLE="APL79 Conference Proceedings",
JOURNAL="ACM SIGAPL Quote Quad",
MONTH=jun,
ABSTRACT="An implementation of APL is necessarily a rigid encoding of the 
rules of the language, including a de facto order in which expressions are 
evaluated. The order of execution is perceived in an APL program by the way 
in which side effects such as nested specification, specification of global 
variables within defined functions, and shared variable values affect the 
outcome of expressions. 

Concern about variation among implementations and distasteful results (see, 
for example, ``APL Problems with Order of Execution'', Clark Wiedmann, in the 
March 1978 issue of Quote Quad) led to a proposed definition for the order 
of evaluation of APL expressions which received general acceptance at an APL 
implementors' workshop at Minnowbrook in September 1977.

The refined `right to left' evaluation rule is examined and compared with 
other possible choices, through the use of simple APL syntax analysis 
models, to determine its implications on storage requirements, computation 
requirements, and mathematical identities.",

ABSTRACT="Several authors have considered the problem of control of program 
flow in secondary (user-written) functions in APL and forms which would
give APL equivalents of the control structures of more traditional 
languages have been proposed. Rather than expanding or altering the means of 
controlling program flow in APL, this paper suggests restricting the forms, 
but not the power, of branching.  The motivation and implicationss are 
presented and the advantages and disadvantages are weighed. Problems of 
migration of functions and questions regarding the resumption of suspended 
functions are considered.  Consideration of function call and the system 
variable, {\apl \qQuad\0lc}, suggests a generalization of secondary-function 
execution with regard to program flow among user-written functions. This 
provides an alternate view of suspended functions and permits branching to 
be generalized to include co-routines.",

TITLE="Smalltalk and Generic Concepts in Programming Languages",
AUTHOR="Alan C. Kay",
PAGES="340--340",
BOOKTITLE="APL79 Conference Proceedings",
JOURNAL="ACM SIGAPL Quote Quad",
MONTH=jun,
ABSTRACT="Early generic concepts in programming languages were 
mixed-type arithmetic (e.g., ``+'' used with any combination of fixed- and 
floating-point numbers) and ``print'' functions which could be applied to any 
of a language's objects. Generic concepts reduce the number of terms which 
must be remembered and permit considerable condensation of language design.
Three different paths in the development of generic-concept languages have 
been followed by APL , Algol 68, and object-oriented languages such aqs
SIMULA~67 and smalltalk. APL was the earliest and one of the most 
interesting applications of generic-concept methods, but now makes the 
weakest use of these ideas.

My talk will use slides and movies to show how the message-object 
programming system Smalltalk makes use of generic concepts embedded in class 
descriptions to give rise to a wide variety of simply programmed dynamic
simulations including graphic animation, music synthesis, document layout
and retrieval, and APL-like calculation features. Many of these systems have 
been brought to life by child and adult novice programmers.",

is adapted to data usage or data. Those parts of records which are estimated 
by the program to be specified very often in queries are included as 
reference strings and inverted. For data access in the retrieval phase, the 
specified attribute values and their logical expressions are transformed 
into a logical expression between reference strings. Primary and secondary
(index) data are stored as external files using auxiliary processors for 
access. The retrieval and udpate functions are combined with the 
user-guidance component used to describe data (dictionary), to teach system 
use, and to assist as a permanently available Help feature. As an internal
structure it uses a semantic net to navigate the user from general to more 
specific information. A new interesting feature is the use of selected 
reference strings and selected combintations of them as a more detailed data 
description extracted automatically from the data or even data usage.",

ABSTRACT="In the first time since the APL 88 congress, IBM has made certain
 announcements in the field of APL products.  The first one was APL2
 Release 3, a second generation APL system, now further enhanced to
 offer support of one of the most advanced pieces of mainframe hardware
 introduced by IBM, the 3090 Vector feature.

 In the workstation environments, IBM has announced APL2/PC.  This
 system includes two different APL2 systems that work in the PC and 
 Personal System/2(tm) environments.  (IBM Personal System/2 and PS/2 
 are trademarks of International Business Machines Corporation).  One
 of them is the first and smallest 16-bit PC DOS-based, APL2 system.
 The second one is a 32-bit system that works on the Intel 386 environment
 (PS/2 models 70 and 80).  In both cases, the language is an almost
 complete subset of mainframe APL2, which makes possible a high degree
 of compatibility and connectivity between mainframe and workstation.",

ABSTRACT="GPSS is a discrete simulation language, suitable for queuing systems.
 Its main advantage is that it is very easy to learn and easy to use, but
 its disadvantages are that it is very clumsy and also very restricted
 in its arithmetic (for example it is integer-valued and has very few
 mathematical functions).  For this reasons we designed a GPSS emulator
 in APL which combines the simple and intuitive syntax of GPSS with the
 powerful calculation capabilities of APL.  The product of this combination
 is the simulation package APL-GPSS.",

ABSTRACT="This paper is an investigation of possible definitions 
of new enclose-like
 functions, their impact on the APL2 language, and their usefulness in
 applications.  Several variants of enclose have been proposed over the
 years that range from data structure primitives to data type producing
 primitives.  Operator analogues of enclose can be used to create functions
 that pervade structures and types in different ways.  Defined operators
 can implement type hierarchy and respond to fill items in prototype
 execution by referring to tables of type characteristics.",

PAGES="31--42",
ABSTRACT=" Scalar functions (i.e., functions whose natural arguments are simple
 scalars) have always had advantages, both in APL1 (VSAPL) and in APL2,
 in being easily extended to arbitrary arrays.  There could be no confusion
 in identifying the arguments for each calculation required.  In APL1 this
 advantage was formalized in what I'll call the conformality property: The
 result of a monadic function has the same shape as the argument; arguments
 for a dyadic function must have the same shape, either initially or after
 scalar extension, and the result also has the common shape.  So when
 APL2 introduced the 'each' operator, language formalizers began saying
 that an 'each-derived' function is always a 'scalar' function -- meaning
 that is has the afore-mentioned conformality property.  (This is fuzzy
 terminology -- only when a simple scalar results from simple scalar
 argument(s) is a function properly categorized as 'scalar' -- but the
 terminology is probably too engrained in the community to eradicate.
 In any case, that's another story.)  From this point, forward, however,
 I use the adjective 'scalar' in its original sense; it WILL NOT refer
 to 'each-derived' functions.
 The introduction of 'each' certainly has been a step forward, but note
 that the original scalar functions have gained no enhancement from it:
 'each' has always been implicit with scalar functions.  In fact, the
 advantage of scalar functions over nonscalar functions has expanded with
 the introduction of nested arrays (which made the 'each' operator a viable
 primitive), since scalar functions apply PERVASIVELY -- i.e., between
 nested arguments all that is required is recursive conformality to all
 depths.  Again, this easy extension to nested arrays is a natural
 consequence of the simplicity of identifying the arguments of scalar
 functions.
 This paper takes a close look at the problem of argument identification
 in arbitrary arrays, and proposes some additional APL2 primitives enabling
 nonscalar functions to be applied pervasively to nested arguments.",

BOOKTITLE="APL89 Conference Proceedings",
JOURNAL="ACM SIGAPL Quote Quad",
KEYWORDS="APL2,GDDM,graphics,panel design",
PAGES="43--53",
ABSTRACT="Performance of APL applications is an important consideration; especially
 when it can be achieved without compromising development time and
 maintainability.
 This paper explores some aspects of creating a high-performance toolkit
 for APL2-based applications using IBM's Graphical Data Display Manager
 (GDDM) software to provide the user interface.  The performance achieved
 by these tools is considerably greater than that given by use of IBM's
 own workspaces distributed with the APL2 product, but the resulting
 application code is equally comprehensible and easy to write.
 Applications developed using these tools have provided performance equal
 to (or better than) equivalent applications coded in FORTRAN and have
 extended the domain of effective APL use.
 The paper makes to attempt to describe GDDM except in the broadest sense;
 it deals only with how it can be accessed from and APL application.",

 presented is intended to model stimulus-response (s-r) chaining, a
 behaviorist theory of serial learning.  Some results obtained from running

TITLE="{APL} at the Crossroads",
BOOKTITLE="APL89 Conference Proceedings",

KEYWORDS="efficiency,history of APL,marketing,performance,software development",
PAGES="68--74",
ABSTRACT="The information processing industry has grown from a small core of
 scientists and engineers to a large sector of the economy in 40 years.
 For half of that period, APL has been available on a variety of machines.
 APL has been hailed as a breakthrough in programming systems, a notation
 used in expressing algorithms which are directly executable.  APL has
 been used to address an extremely broad spectrum of problems.  Why then,
 is there not more interest in APL?  There is littly mention of APL in
 journals, trade papers, and in the employment market.  Why don't we see
 signs of the growing use of APl in the PC segments of the industry?  Why
 do persistent stories about APL's decline circulate?
 Barriers to the growth of APL fall into three categories.  Serious
 objections to APL and a lively body of myth have centered on performance.
 The next barrier is difficulty in packaging and marketing APL environments,
 and the tools needed to support them.  Lastly, APL has become stigmatized
 by the computer industry.  The goal of this paper is to discuss each of
 these topics, and provide a course of action for the future.",

TITLE="An Empirical Study of the Performance of the {APL370} Compiler",
BOOKTITLE="APL89 Conference Proceedings",
JOURNAL="ACM SIGAPL Quote Quad",
KEYWORDS="APL370 compiler,compiler",
PAGES="87--93",
ABSTRACT="The performance of a compiler is usually measured in terms of the execution
 efficience of compiled code and the speed of compilation.  For an APL
 compiler, we are also concerned about its relative performance with respect
 to the interpreter: C/I, the ratio of the speed of compiled code over
 interpretation.  We give performance data on 4 groups of examples of
 moderate size: i) scalar style code where an interpreter does poorly and
 the C/I ratio is very high, ii) good APL style code where interpreter
 still does poorly due to inherent iterativeness or recursion, and the
 C/I ratio is high, and iii) good APL style code where the interpreter is
 very efficient on large data, and the C/I ratio is low, and iv) some 
 particular primitives.  These examples include neural net simulation, 
 machine simulation, network routing, signal processing and mathematical 
 computations.  The APL370 compiler not only speeds up applications of
 iterative nature, but also gives good performance to codes utilizing
 APL's strength such as boolean selection and boolean data manipulation.",

and Microprogramming Concepts",
BOOKTITLE="APL89 Conference Proceedings",
JOURNAL="ACM SIGAPL Quote Quad",
KEYWORDS="computer architecture,microprogramming,simulation,microprogramming",
PAGES="94--100",
ABSTRACT=" Courses in computer architecture, among other things, must address issues
 of CPU design and microprogramming.  Real environments, if even available,
 provide very specialized, vendor specific architecture solutions.  Computer
 architecture for this reason is often approached without the benefit of any
 hands-on experience.  Simulation obviously provides a means of exploring
 new architectures.  However, simulation tools in the architecture area
 tend to be highly specialized, typically dictating CPU design and 
 microprogramming organization.  If engineering-level concerns of speed or
 timing considerations are not at issue, APL provides a uniquely effective
 base for building a general simulation tool to implement both mundane and
 exotic microprogrammable CPU designs.  The authors have conceived and
 developed such an environment using APL.  Both students and instructor
 can use the simulation toolkit to 'implement' CPU designs or install an
 existing CPU architecture.  The user can specify registers and function
 modules activated by bits in the microinstructions.  CPU bus structures,
 the microprogram store, main memory and its access scheme are 
 user-definable.  An interface guides the construction of microcode.  The
 simulation can be operated one instruction at a time, one microinstruction
 at a time, or integral multiples of either.  A student-ready version has
 been successfully class tested during the 1989 Spring semester.",

TITLE="High Productivity Techniques for Large {APL} Systems",
BOOKTITLE="APL89 Conference Proceedings",
JOURNAL="ACM SIGAPL Quote Quad",
KEYWORDS="large systems,maintenance,productivity,structured techniques",
PAGES="101--106",
ABSTRACT=" A manager in a large finance company once informed me that she would not
 use APL for business applications since it 'could not be maintained.'
 She thought APL code was too concise to understand quickly, and that APL
 programmers were hard to find and inexperienced with the requirements of
 managing large business systems.
 The business manager needs to experience APL's speed and flexibility in
 order to understand that concise, symbolic notation actually makes modules
 easier to code and maintain.  Yet APL literature has very little information
 about maintaining systems.  It appears that we consider the code to be
 'self-documenting' and easily replaced or rewritten in order to make
 corrections and/or enhancements.
 If APL is maintainable because it's concise and modularized, is there a
 point at which an APL system gets so large that it needs some of the
 structured techniques designed for other large business systems?  How
 might such techniques be modified to work for developing prototypes or
 for smaller programming teams with faster turn-around time?
 This paper will discuss some of the problems experienced by large systems
 and how they can be resolved by using structured techniques borrowed from
 traditional project management.",

MicroAPL",
PAGES="117--123",
ABSTRACT=" The Romford Brewing Company's main brewing and kegging plant is situated
 at Romford, to the east of London.  As a subsidiary of Allied Lions, the
 Romford Brewing Company handles brewing and distribution of a number of
 leading brands of beer in the South East of England.  RBC project engineers
 decided to implement a comprehensive management information system to
 monitor beer production and kegging line performance.  Work began on this
 system as the production lines neared completion.
 This paper describes the plant monitoring system at Romford, with
 particular emphasis on the rationale behind the system design.  For a
 variety of reasons APL was chosen as the prime vehicle for the information
 system.  Amongst these reasons: APL was already in use for 
some mainframe systems at Romford, no suitable packaged software 
was available, and the system specification could not be completed 
until the line was running and the first users had access to the system.
 All these are familiar reasons why APL gets used for computer systems.
 The real-time aspect of the system - that is the collection of data as
 it came off the process controllers - was not initially seen as a major
 constraint as it was believed that a single fairly simple data feed 
 could be provided.  In the event, multiple data feeds were installed, but 
 the computer hardware and software specifications were sufficiently 
 conservative to cope with the eventual site requirements.",

KEYWORDS="APL2,volatility,bond price modelling",
PAGES="129--135",
ABSTRACT=" Black Tuesday, October 19, 1987 is a date etched in the minds of the
 entire financial community.  What the general public remembers less
 well is what came next.  The market did not free fall to zero.  It went
 into wild swings both up and down.  Entire equity positions could be
 halved (or doubled!) between opening and closing bells.  Interday price
 swings commonly exceeded previous inter-month movements.  Investors now
 must evaluate and price risks not only on market trends, but also with
 respect to variations around the trends.  Traditional financial tools
 such as net present value and internal rate of return are themselves
 inadequate to the demands imposed by recent market experience.  Traders
 have turned to the more complex models that account for movements in risk.
 The cost of this approach is complicated mathematics, equally difficult
 programming, and consequent slow run times.  APL2 can aid in controlling
 program complexity and improve run times.  This paper will demonstrate a
 new approach to pricing interest rate volatility and its APL2 
implementation.",

 driven by a game simulator.
 The teaching aspect is integrated as follows:  The adventurer/student
 is a specific actor who is presented with a number of exercises that are
 selected by 'teachers', another special class of actors, on the basis of
 the APL2-knowledge obtained by the student so far.  The solutions entered
 into the system are analysed by the teachers, who use an LR(1)-parser
 generator and 'critic program' to give advice on proper APL2-programming.",

BOOKTITLE="APL89 Conference Proceedings",
JOURNAL="ACM SIGAPL Quote Quad",
PAGES="169--177",
ABSTRACT=" The APL language is widely recognized as a powerful interactive tool for
 instructing a computer.  Typical uses include models used in higher-level
 decision-making processes.  The point of this paper is that the implicit
 search for results for management needs to be made more formal and
 measurable.
 The virtue of a formal language should not be limited to expressing 
 logical constructs for the computer.  It should be extended to cover the 
 underlying reasons for the effort from the point of view of the ultimate
 customer of the service.
 The essential supplements to the tool-kit of the APL user should be an
 understanding of how to quantify and track all result concepts.  In
 addition a more formal understanding of the evolutionary result delivery
 process, which is implicit in normal APL use, would be an advantage.
 This paper will outline an extended tool-kit for the APL user, which
 we call 'A Planning Language', sometimes shortening is to 'Planguage'.
 I have developed a more formal way to do this than most people currently
 use, utilizing a strategy evaluation matrix language and
other language elements for establishing relationships.",

PAGES="231--241",
ABSTRACT=" This paper describes a form of data typing implemented in APL.  By contrast
 with conventional data typing, which basically specifies a storage format
 for a data type, it is a means of specifying the set of logical values
 that a variable is to be permitted to take.  To assign a data type, a new
 copula analogous to value-assign is used.  Hence only a single new symbol
 is added to APL, not a whole data typing sub-language, but the full power
 of APL is available to define a type.

 The objectives and overall design of the data typing are described, plus
 an overview of its usefulness in writing application software.",

TITLE="Techniques for Avoiding Conditional Execute in {APL2}",
BOOKTITLE="APL89 Conference Proceedings",
JOURNAL="ACM SIGAPL Quote Quad",
KEYWORDS="conditional execute,execute",
PAGES="242--248",
ABSTRACT=" Execute is unique among the APL2 primitive functions in that it is
 the only one which does not necessarily produce an explicit result.  This
 makes it convenient for executing an APL expression conditionally.  Execute
 is also unique in that it is the only symbolic primitive which permits
 only a character argument.  This tends to produce awkward programming.

 This paper will look at ways to avoid the use of conditional execute by
 suggesting alternate methods and ways of thinking which are unique to
 APL.  These methods have been used to great advantage in production code.

 Most examples of code used in this paper have been taken from an actual
 APL2 application.  Although most of the examples are in APL2, many will
 work in other APL dialects.  Some minor modifications have been made to
 the code in the interests of security and clarity.  Most of these involved
 changing the names of some functions or variables.",

PAGES="285--288",
ABSTRACT="An APL workspace is developed for the purpose of calculating numerical
 values of derivitaves.  The heart of the method, called automatic
 differentiation, is manipulation of numerical vectors -- an APL way of
 thinking.  The method is not symbolic manipulation as taught in calculus,
 nor is it approximation as taught in numerical analysis.  Automatic
 differentiation is implemented as a workspace (called GRADIENT) of 14
 simple, one-line, numerical vector functions that perform all of the
 formal differentiation rules.  The ideas are introduced for simple first
 derivatives of single variable functions.  We then show that the GRADIENT
 workspace enables the calculation of all first-order partial derivatives
 of any typical function in any number of variables.  This workspace is
 used as a tool in the solution of systems of nonlinear equations by
 Newton's method.  Finally, we discuss how APL concepts led to a new
 approach to higher-order derivatives for problems that overwhelm commercial
 symbolic differentiation programs; moreover, the resulting accuracy cannot
 be obtained by numerical approximation techniques.",

BOOKTITLE="APL89 Conference Proceedings",
JOURNAL="ACM SIGAPL Quote Quad",
KEYWORDS="astrophysics,white dwarf,stellar structure,degeneracy,
general relativity",
PAGES="304--311",
ABSTRACT="Computational astrophysics seeks to develop numerical models which help
 elucidate the nature of astronomical systems.  Such models must not only
 adequately describe the underlying physics which give rise to phenomena
 that have been observed, but must also be predictive in asserting what
 future observations might unfold.  Any model which is in conflict with
 physical observations, clearly, must be discarded or amended to reflect
 reality.  As a computational modelling tool we find APL useful for testing
 astrophysical hypotheses, and extending the domain of our observationally
 based knowledge.  Using APL to build, test, and expand astrophysical models
 frees the investigator from the mechanical drudgery of computer programming, 
 thereby allowing the researcher to concentrate on understanding the physical
 universe.
 As a quantitative example of how relatively complex astrophysical phenomena
 can be explored with ease using APL, we have developed a structure model
 for white dwarf stars.  The model presented here considers such effects as
 Coulomb interactions between electrons and nucleons, inverse beta decays,
 and the effects of the general theory of relativity on the condition of
 hydrostatic equilibrium.  This structure model is valid for zero-temperature
 stars of varying chemical compositions, ionic partitions, and central
 densities; and is applicable over a wide range of partial and total
 degeneracy regimes.",

PAGES="312--319",
ABSTRACT=" A long standing problem in the field of robotics has been that of 'reverse
 kinematics', which translates as the problem of finding the controllable
 parameters of a robot arm that will place the hand in a desired orientation
 (which means both position and direction).  This problem is the reverse of
 'forward kinematics', which is almost trivial in comparison.  It has been
 singularly intractable for 'general' arms, and the vast majority of 
 commercial robots are carefully constructed, in part, to reduce the problem
 to manageable proportions.
 This paper describes the process by which APL2 software solves the 'reverse
 kinematics' problem for one general class of robot arm.",

ABSTRACT=" Online documentation is defined as 'Communication designed to be presented

 This paper sets out a way of interfacing on-line documentation with APL2
 programs.  It uses GDDM as the full-screen manager, and the text is stored
 in a VSAM file, although this is pure convenience and a BDAM file could
 be used by those sites where personnel are not trained in VSAM, or VSAM is
 not available.
 The HELP function is shown in the appendix together with the format of a
 HELP record from the file; these will show that the concept is beautifully
 simple.  Feedback from staff in my organization has shown that this kind
 of on-line 'HELP' facility has been most useful in assisting everybody

simulation,SDM,sparse distributed memory",
PAGES="334--340",
ABSTRACT=" APL functions provide concise, array-oriented expressions for describing
 connection-based computing.  These give insights into a variety of neural
 network-like computer models.  Functional decomposition into inherently
 parallel operation of collective or memory-based computing is effected
 with the identification of several command-like APL simulation functions.
 These functions serve to: (a) generate and configure initial values and
 structures for network layers, connection weights and thresholds, (b)
 strategically sample training sets to provide acyclic sequences of patterns,
 (c) update weights for memorizing or learning from the training set, (d)
 locate units effective for storing and retrieving memories, and (e) use
 a cue or noise-corrupted pattern for recalling or reconstructing memory
 associations established during training.  Also, APL functions are used
 to accomodate for data values missing from the training patterns.  Other
 simply described functions generate random fixed reference addresses and
 initialize modifiable weight values.  Test patterns with specified levels
 of noise contamination are generated by simple APL expressions.",

ABSTRACT="
{\em Array morphology} is the study of the form, structure, and 
evolution of arrays. An {\em array annotation} for a program written in
an applicative array language is an abstract syntax tree
for the program, amended with information about the arrays created 
by that program. Array notations are useful in the production of efficient 
compiled code for applicative array programs.
Array morphology is shown to be an effective compiler writer's 
tool.
Examples of an array annotator in action are presented, showing its value in 
array morphology.
Array morphology is shown to 
provide methods for static detection of certain classes of programming 
errors.

{\em Assertions} are a generalization of declarations that
offer significant benefits to application writers as well as compiler 
writers. Although assertions are executable code, they can often be 
evaluated at compilation time.
Assertions, and therefore declarations, may be represented 
as conjunctions, and are, therefore, conforming extensions to 
ISO Standard APL. A {\em domain conjunction} is offered as an example 
of how assertions might be defined in APL or J.",

ABSTRACT="Although multicomputers are becoming feasible for solving large 
problems, they are difficult to program: Extraction of parallelism from
scalar languages is possible, but limited. Parallelism in 
algorithm design is difficult for those who think in von Neumann terms.
Portability of programs and programming skills can only be achieved
by hiding the underlying machine architecture from the user, yet this
may impact performance on a specific host.

APL, J, and other applicative array languages with adequately rich
semantics can do much to solve these problems. 
The paper discusses the value of abstraction and semantic richness, 
performance issues, 
portability, potential degree of parallelism, data distribution, 
process creation, communication and synchronization, frequency of program
faults, and clarity of expression. The BLAS are used as a basis for comparison 
with traditional supercomputing languages.",

ABSTRACT="Classical algorithms and data structures as made popular by 
Knuth's {\em The Art of Computer Programming} have been largely ignored 
so far by APL2 programmers.
This was understandable to a certain degree in the era of APL, but has
lost its justification with the rise of APL2 and similar APL successors. 
First, the
essence of classical algorithms as well as the principal ways 
of data structuring
and accessing are reexamined. Then it is shown how pseudocode 
implementations of classical algorithms can be transferred one-to-one 
into APL2
almost automatically and often with acceptable performance.
In general, the better way consists in maintaining only the 
general design principle
behind a classical algorithm and combining it with the elegant and efficient
specific possibilities of APL2. Both approaches are explained and 
illustrated by
means of a typical classical algorithm from picture processing.",

JOURNAL="ACM SIGAPL Quote Quad",
MONTH=aug,EDITOR="Elena M. Anzalone",
ABSTRACT="APL is often presented as a notation that is independent of national language
because of its symbolic nature. Paradoxically its unique character set 
has led to
APL being treated as if it were itself a national language. This has meant, in
many practical situations, that the APL character set is incompatible with 
national language character sets.

IBM's APL2 attempted to avoid these problems by defining a set of extended (31
bit) characters, and this has indeed been helpful in handling Asian 
languages such
as Kanji. But the character mappings adopted have not been adequate to support
all European and Middle Eastern language characters, nor have they been
consistent across platforms.

With the advent of international standards for character assignment, there is an
opportunity to create APL systems that handle the character sets of the world in
an efficient and elegant manner. While at first the solution appears 
to require only
a recitation of code point assignment, an analysis of the problem leads to
interesting and disturbing questions about a number of APL system functions,
system variable,s commands, and file facilities. This paper explores 
problems with
internal conversions, external representation, migration, compatibility, and
interplatform portability.",

the programmer to follow them and much good work can be undone by a few

ABSTRACT="One can distinguish two different approaches of neural networks. The supervised
networks and the self-organizing or unsupervised neural networks. The first type
of neural nets is supplied with an ideal result regarding the input. During the
learning procedure the neural net adjusts weighting factors of the links between
neurons so that the input feature vectors map to the ideal output. Those nets are
used for example in robotics, where the ideal result is well known: it is the
position the robot should be placed in. For the cases where no ideal result is
known, the second type of neural nets, the so-called self-learning Topological
Feature Map (TFM) is appropriate. This paper will introduce such a neural net
based on the idea of Kohonen's TFM. The original algorithm was extremely
sequential and therefore not suitable for an APL implementation. The
parallelization of the algorithm led to important improvements regarding speed

ABSTRACT="This paper describes the design of a hybrid language that combines the

This language, APROCL (Array PROCessing Lisp) is derived from the J dialect

taken from
Scheme, while the array processing features are based on the J programming
language. A prototype implementation has been made and some experiences with
this implementation are described. This implementation uses J as an embedded
array processing engine in a Scheme interpreter/compiler.

The language as specified provides a set of data types and manipulation 
tools that
is more diverse than found in either Scheme or J. APROCL allows the
programmer to apply array processing functions to lists of arrays in the Scheme
style and list processing functions to arrays of lists in typical 
J style. The result is
a language that not only brings array processing capabilities to Scheme, 
but also
significantly extends the functionality of the Scheme language.",

ABSTRACT="APL as a language has always provided a high level of abstraction to its users.
Only in the field of communication have APL channels -- called 
shared variables -- been restricted to at

more than two interacting programs, APL users had to use their own 
techniques to develop applications that share information among 
more than
two partners. This paper presents a proposal to move the administration 
of shared
memory from the application to the language level: An extension 
to the well-known
shared variable protocol to share memory among more than two partners. A
programming technique -- replicated workers -- and a sample application for
students that learn APL in a working group are shown that take advantage of 
this
feature. These are both based on a prototype implementation of the proposed

the method of developing an application using APL2 and the concepts of defined
operators and function arrays. This requires that input functions be robustly
designed to take arrays as arguments and to produce array results much like
primitive scalar functions. In this manner one can minimize the number of calls to
the input function and take advantage of APL2's array handling capabilities. Since
operators are permitted at most two operands, it is critical to minimize the number
of input functions. This requires the input function designer to think in terms of
function arrays. Although function arrays are not yet part of the language, they
can easily be defined in most any version of APL.",

ABSTRACT="The arbitrary nesting and moting (infinite successive singling) of arrays of 
such nestings and motings results in forms, each of which may be viewed 
simultaneously as an array of items, a bush of buds, and a tree of leaves. 
Such forms of totally defined $\em 0^{th}$- , $\em 1^{st}$-, $\em 2^{\em nd}$-, or 
$\em 3^{\em rd}$-order functions are again totally defined functions of the same 
order, called, respectively, figures, changes, rigs, and arms. One arms a 
rig before rigging a change, before changing a figure. Part I of this paper 
presents the background and reasons for this new terminlogy, which is chosen 
to emphasize the abstraction of figures from material bodies, the analogy 
between array-theoretic and Euclidean figures, the analysis of form 
separately from substance, the effect of combining form with substance, the 
extension of $\em N+1^{\em st}$-order functions from data-driven form to inherent 
form, and the totality of their definition.
When combined with the usual array-theoretic functions of
$\em 0^{\em th}$- ,$\em 1^{\em st}$- , and $\em 2^{\em nd}$-orders, the purely structural operations 
($\em 1^{\em st}$-order functions) of moting and inverse moting operations introduce 
and remove layers of transfinite nesting that enable one to control, by 
structure alone, where $\em N+1^{\em st}$-order functions apply. Part II of this 
paper discusses the nature of transfinite nesting and analyzes a potential 
contradiction. Equations relate moting and inverse moting not only 
structural array-theoretic operations but also to pervasive and pervading 
operations. The algebra of $\em 0^{\em th}$- ,$\em 1^{\em st}$- , and $\em 2^{\em nd}$-order
functions is extended to $\em 3^{\em rd}$-order functions.",

ABSTRACT="Maximum likelihood estimators used in statistics and econometrics have desirable
properties; however, due to the complexity of their solution maximum likelihood
techniques are not widely used. This paper examines an APL implementation of
one of the most efficient algorithms used to estimate the parameters of the
univariate ARMA process. The straightforward use of APL is found to be
unacceptable and so a systematic search for optimization is made. This search
results in an approximate solution for the ML estimator, the use of 
Quad-na 
and FORTRAN, and special matrix techniques to increase the efficiency of the
algorithm. The matrix techniques used are implementations of sparse, banded, and
block diagonal data structures. Additional matrix techniques involve incremental
updating of matrices. The effect of these optimizations is to bring the
computational cost from an O(N$^{\em 3}$) problem to an O(N$^{\em 1}$) problem. This
translates into a significant reduction in computer requirements. 
For example, to
estimate a six parameter ARMA model with 5000 observations, memory
requirements fall from approximately 95 Mb to 300 kb. Computer time falls from
about 400 years to about 2 minutes.",

polynomials has only two of the variables). While subject to the known stability

ABSTRACT="The paper considers Adaptive Learning Networks (ALN) as a tool to
solve the problems of modeling, prediction, diagnostics and
pattern recognition in complex systems. This method is similar to
the neural network technique. The main difference is the self-organization
of network structure on the basis of generation and estimation
of various nodes, connections and weights. A set of functions
presented in the paper shows that ALNs are easily realized in APL2.
User-defined operators are used as a very convenient tool for ALN
programming. The paper discusses the application of implemented
software to the problem of Burnout Heat Flux Prediction in nuclear
reactors. It is shown that ALN technique allows the prediction of burnout
heat flux with approximately three times better accuracy than other
commonly used methods.",

language J, an APL derivative with very powerful function encapsulation features.
Both the languages J and APL help to identify and isolate the parallelism that is
inherent in network training algorithms. Non-critical details of data input and
derived output processes are de-emphasized by relegating those functions to
callable stand-alone modules. Such input and output modules can be isolated and
customized individually for managing communication with arbitrary, external
storage systems. The central objective of this research is the design and precise
description of a neural network training kernel. Such kernel designs are valuable
for producing efficient reusable computer codes and facilitating the transfer of
neural network technology from developers to users.",

wrapped around with a great blanket of user code, which is 
all about the entry,
validation, and presentation of data.

With the advent of MS Windows (and the inevitable move of the PC community
toward Windows applications) we can begin to exploit the inherent power of
Word and Excel as native components of our APL development. This paper
begins the exploration, with just two simple ideas: an APL button-bar for

(for Excel freaks who have begun to want a real array language), and an

function and its derivatives up to any specified order.
It is argued that, for teaching purposes, this
sampling provides a more intuitive introduction to
mathematical functions and the rules of calculus than do
algebraic formulae and that for certain calculations
(such as the computation of polynomial approximations of
high degree) the formulation provides superior algorithms
for computation.  As such, it offers an alternative

production workspaces. Periodically, the WSM installs new releases of production
workspaces by merging new and changed objects into existing workspaces. Audit
trails are maintained for all of these activities, making it possible to review the
change history of an object, compare different versions of an object, compare
different releases of a workspace, revert to an old release of a workspace, and so

ABSTRACT="Statistics textbooks expound the collection of techniques 
known as {\bf analysis
of variance} by using mathematical formulae. The term analysis of variance is
something of a misnomer, since any analysis follows a primary exercise of
partitioning sums of squares, that is entirely a matter of computation and data
reorganization of the sort at which APL2 is uniquely adept. The crux of the
analysis stage then consists of making choices between what is often a
bewilderingly large range of subtly different sums of squares partitions. The
primitive function {\bf enclose with axis} maps naturally into the data
manipulations involved in sums of squares partitions for arrays. To the casual
reader the latter are obscured rather than clarified by the use of mathematical
formulae alone. This paper explores the relationship between APL2 functions and
ANOVA, and goes on to illustrate how these can be used in the context of a
designed experiment.",

shown to be robust by showing their use in the creation of traditional control
structures. A method of conversion to ISO APL is also presented.

This paper briefly discusses proposals that have been made in the past along with
an evaluation of their merits and shortcomings. The paper ends with a discussion
of related issues, including elimination of branching, introduction 
of definition blocks, and lexical scoping in APL. Several areas for continuing work are

re-evaluated, to show the benefits of dynamic programming.
The dynamic programming algorithm is then recast to use flow control 
structures recently introduced into ISI J and APL*PLUS III. 
Use of control structures in conjunction with dynamic programming results 
in orders of magnitude performance improvement over brute force and 
naive recursive algorithms. APL*PLUS III control structures are shown 
to provide a performance improvement of up to 30% over GOTO-based

ABSTRACT="Automatic differentiation, manipulating numerical vectors of 
coefficients, is the efficient way to compute multivariable Taylor series. 
This does not require symbolic differentiation or numerical 
approximation but uses exact formulae applied to numerical arrays. Arrays of
Taylor series coefficients of any elementary function can be built up, 
as the array for each component combination or function is a 
combination of the argument arrays. The functions TIMES and EXP display 
the algorithmic ideas that enable all of the other standard functions. 
We study the interesting recursive formulae for these combinations, 
the resulting algorithms, and their implementation in APL. To handle 
all coefficients in $n$ variables up to order $m$, the arrays are hyper-pyramid 
data structures as discussed in earlier work by Neidinger. Unlike that 
work, this
implementation does not require huge binomial coefficient and indirect 
reference arrays. While the abstract $n$-dimensional hyper-pyramid is 
helpful in conceptualizing the necessary operations, the implementation is 
achieved with one-dimensional arrays of coefficients and nested arrays 
for index referencing. The APL*PLUS III implementation loops through one
nested reference array and takes sub-arrays from another for a 
practical solution to this problem that can make tremendous demands 
on time and space.",

ABSTRACT="In 1993, Austria had the highest number of bankruptcies since 1945. 
The total liabilities came to approximately US\$3 billion. Powerful tools for 
early detection of company risks are very important to avoid high economic 
losses. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are suitable for many tasks in 
pattern recognition and machine learning. In this paper we present an ANN 
for early detection of company failures using balance sheet ratios.
The network has been successfully tested with real data on Austrian 
private limited companies. The research activities included the design of an
APL application with a graphical user interface to find out the relevant 
input data and tune the ANN. The developed APL workspace takes advantage of 
modern windowing features running on IBM-compatible computers.",

ABSTRACT="This paper describes and contrasts the implementation of namespaces in two 
popular combinations of APL dialects and platforms. IBM's APL2 (version 2
release 2) running under VM/CMS, and Dyadic's Dyalog APL/W (version 7.0) 
running under Microsoft Windows. 
In a traditional APL workspace, localization is the only mechanism available 
to isolate identifier names and values, and it is extremely potent. While a 
function that localizes a given name is executing, it is impossible to 
reference any other definition of that name.
Namespaces are a significant addition to an APL system. They provide a way 
to {\em package} a collection of objects (variables, defined functions, 
etc.), and insulate them from the traditional workspace. A namespace 
co-exists with the workspace, yet its object names and definitions are 
completely independent of the workspace. 
Namespaces can help to organize and hide complexity in workspaces, avoid 
name conflicts, and share code among applications.
IBM has offered namespaces in APL2 since 1987, whereas Dyadic has just 
recently introduced their facility. Both implementations provide 
encapsulation and name isolation within a workspace. But they use quite 
different methods to access objects in a namespace and store their initial 
definitions. The merits of each approach are discussed.
An example is provided to illustrate how namespaces may be used to simplify 
the implementation and improve the functionality of workspace and function 
analysis tools.",

ABSTRACT="Since Karmarkar's paper of 1984, interior
point methods for linear programming have developed sufficiently
to challenge the traditional simplex method, especially on large problems.
Moreover, interior point methods generalize to certain types of non-linear
problems that cannot be handled by the simplex method. A search of 
the internet will reveal a number of software packages that implement 
interior point methods for linear and non-linear problems.
The programming languages used include
FORTRAN, C, PASCAL, and (most frequently) MATLAB.
Examination of these codes show that they involve extensive manipulation of 
arrays of numbers. Some MATLAB codes use arrays of dimension greater than
two and arrays whose elements are arrays. Higher dimensional and nested 
arrays are a recent addition to MATLAB (added in Version 5, the current
version) but have been available in APL and J for some time. Why is the 
arrays processing language MATLAB such a popular choice rather than APL or 
J? Is this an area where APL and J can make a contribution? To gain 
insight into these questions, we compare interior point methods written in 
MATLAB to code written in APL and J.",

ABSTRACT="The Collateral Analysis System (CAS) is an analytic database

selection statements, calculations, and summary expressions. 
An expression is a combination of {\em constants}, {\em fields}, and {\em 
user functions} which can form a selection statement, new field calculation, 
or frequency report specification. 
Users can generate tailor-made reports without programming. They simply 
enter expressions and format data and save the information with the 
database. Then, with the touch of a button, they can generate reports
quickly and easily. CAS expressions are merely APL expressions in disguise.",

ABSTRACT="Most of the existing high-level array processing languages support 
a fixed set of pre-defined array operations and a few higher-order functions 
for constructing new array operations from existing ones. In this paper, ew 
discuss a more general approach made feasible by Sac (for Single Assignment 
C), a functional variant of C.
Sac provides a meta-level language construct called WITH-loop which may be 
considered a sophisticated variant of the FORALL-loops in HPF or of array 
comprehensions in functional languages. It allows for the element-wise
specification of high-level operations on arrays of any dimensionality:
any set of high-level array operations can be specified by means of
WITH-loops and be made available in a library. This does not only improve
the flexibility of specifications, but also simplifies the compilation 
process. By means of a few examples it is shown that the high-level 
operations that are typically available in array processing languages such 
as APL or Fortran90 can be easily specified as WITH-loops in SAC. 
Furthermore, we briefly outline the most important optimization techniques 
used in the current SAC compiler for achieving efficiently executable code.
The paper finally presents a performance comparison between a high-level
specification for the multi-grid relaxation kernel of the NAS benchmarks in 
Sac on the one hand and low-level specifications in SISAL and in Fortran~77
on the other hand. It shows that the Sac implementation, despite its higher 
level of abstraction, is competitive with the other two both in terms of
program run times and memory consumption.",

ABSTRACT="Languages with array-based semantics, such as APL and J,
frequently lend themselves to the description of non-iterative
solutions to problems with traditionally explicitly iterative solutions.
ALthough these non-iterative solutions are often terse, enlightening,
and obviously correct, they often are impractical for realistic
use. This is because their computational complexity, both in time and
space, result in unacceptably high execution time and memory requirements.
These computational complexity problems can sometimes be alleviated without
recourse to explicit iteration or recursion by writing subtle
problems that exploit classical methods such as sorting or reduction.
Unfortunately, these methods generally produce 
unsatisfying programs, in the sense that their didactic nature and
their feeling of mathematical correctness is lost. Furthermore, 
they may introduce undesired errors, due to factors such as 
unforeseen loss of precision or edge conditions.
Finally, these subtle algorithms remain unsatisfying from the computer
scientist's point of view, because their computational complexity
remains higher than that of an obvious algorithm expressed in a
scalar-oriented language.
This paper describes several techniques used in the APEX APL compiler
to reduce the computational complexity of APL expressions to that
of scalar-oriented algorithms, while preserving the didactic clarity
of expression. Specifically, we address the following types of
complexity and describe how to reduce them:
reducing certain upgrades and sorts to linear time; reducing common array 
search expressions to linear time; eliminating intermediate result arrays; 
and simplifying functional compositions through algebraic analysis.
Examples are chosen from the APL literature to demonstrate these
techniques.",

ABSTRACT="A language like APL was a masterpiece of simplification when seen

Possibilities for further simplification are then canvassed. Firstly,
simplification of the usually accepted but unfortunate naming conventions
adopted by array processing languages is proposed. Secondly, simplification 
of the arithmetic is very briefly outlined, more detailed treatment of this 
topic being available elsewhere. Thirdly, syntactic means for having all 
functions and operations dyadic are treated, and the advantages of adopting 
such means evaluated. Fourthly, the possibilities for a newly distinctive 
kind of function (called extractions) are described. These are considered as 
a kind of systematic renaming to supply arguments to functions. Fifthly, and 
in the context of J's simplifications, the need for hyperoperators is 
asserted. Finally, the nature of interpreters for array processing languages 
is reviewed, and suggestions made for facilities to be provided by such

ABSTRACT="APL is like FORTH, a powerful programming language which deserves 
to be better known. Despite its unusual style and its power, it remains too 
confidential. In my job, I often notice that, in order to solve little 
problems, our PCs and their software become unfriendly, and their 
documentation too important. In addition, sometimes, they are out of our 
reach and the solution of the problem takes time. Even if their size 
reduction has made a lot of progress in a few years, they do not always have 
the easiness of pocket calculators. Although modern pocket calculators offer 
mathematical functions ale to satisfy the major part of the users, they are, 
according to me, too much oriented towards mathematics, and they have a lack 
of generality for operations on arrays, and could be complex to master.
There is, in fact, a powerful programming language, easy to master and which 
offers the best generality: APL. For a practical use, it could be the best, 
because it's powerful, its programs are concise, quickly written, and this 
is an important factor in order to minimize the effort of typing on the 
keyboard. This conclusion suggests me to build an APL pocket calculator 
which could offers us a powerful computing power in a small size. If we 
could implement programmable facilities, this could promote this kind of APL

ABSTRACT="In this paper, we wish to outline a new idea, namely the 
object-oriented positioning using simple tools of set theory and 
combinatorics. Nowadays the domain of a structured spatial positioning 
system are extended only to simple 2D or 3D boundary rectangle
(MBR -- Minimal axes-parallel Boundary Rectangle) domains. We try to 
encapsulate the domains strictly for the inside and/or the boundary 
(surface) of the object during our attempts. In case of such domains, it is 
impossible to use traditional coordinates because of boundary irregularity.
Therefore, we applied 2D and 3D versions of sub-range type data structure 
for spatial indexing which is well known from dynamic program languages. The 
two important methods of combinatorics, namely, the enumeration and the 
ranking-unranking were also applied so the spatial index (or rank) used by 
us derived from a ranking procedure. During development, we had to partially 
modify and extend the traditional concepts of the circumference and
the area, moreover, the surface and volume also. There was a natural 
possibility with creation of nested OOP superclasses and subclasses by means 
of inheritance to transmit the transformation parameters (translation, 
orientation, etc.) between positioning systems, which belong to different 
classes. This solution -- in contrast to coordinate systems -- is 
database-friendly because it is consequently redundantless and it uses the 
irregular bounded real spatial objects itself as domains. Developing hidden 
virtual systems at any time can be performing a transformation between
any kind of coordinates and linear indices according to polymorphism. 
Thus, our J-based positioning system can be rightly called object oriented 
including every advantage and disadvantage of it.",

porting to Dyalog APL for MS Windows 95 currently is under evaluation.
First, the article briefly presents the package and its features. The body 
of the article is devoted to a discussion of the advantages (and sometimes,
limitations) that the use of APL in general and APL.68000 in particular
has provided in the following areas during the design and implementation 
phases of AxE: algorithm coding, user interface generation, and management 
of a relatively large and complex application. AxE is currently available

ABSTRACT="Since the seventies the negative demographic growth in the western 
countries, and especially in Italy, has led to a continuous population 
decrease and an increase of aged people. This trend must be controlled for 
its inevitable negative effects on the socio-economical relations and must 
be counteracted by new policies. The aim of this paper will be to suggest a 
way of handling demographic data which could be of easy access to a large 
number of users at various territorial levels (national, regional, 
subregional, municipal). In order to achieve this goal, a method to 
implement the mathematical model for short and long term population 
projection will be provided. The software used will be Excel and APL2.
Excel provides the variables and the input parameters of the model written 
in APL2. The projection results go back to the Excel environment in order to 
be processed and interpreted.",

ABSTRACT="Algorithm and software prototyping using APL2 has been effective 
in developing several new capabilities for space object tracking using 
satellite-based sensors. Applications include sensor simulation, sensor 
scheduling, orbit propagation, and refinement of space object orbital 
parameters using sensor observations. This work capitalized on a rich APL 
function library and experience in both missile tracking and orbital 
applications related to GPS (Global Positioning System). For each of these 
applications, APL2 provided a prototyping environment that was rapid and 
effective. Even the sensor-scheduling problem, which required tasking 
tens of satellites to observe thousands of space objects multiple times per 
orbit, was amenable to an APL solution. This paper provides an overview of 
space object tracking algorithms that we recently developed, and the 
techniques used to develop a complete end-to-end simulation test bed. We 
also discuss conversion of the prototype code to production code that is 
delivered to the customer. We also discuss the relative merits of this 
approach compared with alternative approaches such as COTS. Overall we have 
found APL to be ideal in supporting simulation and rapid development of 
large-scale applications of national importance.",

ABSTRACT="The course of calculation methods is standard for mathematical and 
engineering high education. It is common to organize the computational 
practice by the aid of classic languages such as C or PASCAL. But, it is 
obvious that many details, which accompany the programming in these 
languages, are redundant for teaching the calculations themselves. 
APL is very useful in this sense. At first, the interactivity of APL,
secondly many incorporated functions, thirdly pliability of array processing 
are the main features which give advantages in programming of calculation 
methods. The new facilities in APL such as nested arrays or each and 
composition operators give additional power. We shall discuss in this 
communication our experience of teaching the classical course of calculation 
methods for the students in mathematics by the aid of Dyalog APL. Our course 
includes the following topics: solution of systems of non-linear equations, 
numerical differentiation and integration, interpolation with curves and 
splines, solutions of Couchy and boundary problems for ordinary differential 
equations. The idea of this course was to illustrate the calculation methods 
as the mathematical models, which can be quickly modified, used in other 
models as `black box' and simultaneously applied to solution of sets of 
problems. We show that the method programmed in APL is very useful for 
investigation of the influence of parameters of the problem and of the 
methods themselves. You can see that many calculation problems are 
programmed as defined Dyadic APL-operators with function as first argument 
and data (parameters of method) as second one. The possibility to create the 
derived function with the aid of such operator is a very powerful means for 
programming of calculation methods modification. We use the graphical 
system GRAN written in APL to illustrate the numerical solutions. Of course, 
there is a very big problems with the speed of calculations. we have 
previously shows that these problems could be solved by introducing the
recurrent operator in APL because nearly ALL calculation methods are 
recurrences in APL terms. From the other hand, the problem of speed is not 
very important for solution of educational problems.",

ABSTRACT="The fascinating, often complex, often context-sensitive, classical 
mathematical notation presents a host of problems for machine 
interpretation. For those who foresee an educational environment in which 
interactive course material is delivered world-wide across the Web, the 
demand of universities (the accrediting agencies) for mastery of the 
classical notation is somewhat frustrating. Computer-based notations, on the 
other hand, can also sometimes be clumsy, confusing, inelegant, and 
aesthetically displeasing. A solution to this impasse might seem to be yet 
some way off. Nevertheless, as students, rather than instructors, 
increasingly come to determine the choice of purchase in educational 
products, it might prove to be possible to acquire mastery of classical 
notation by routes other than the traditional ones. The University of 
Southern Queensland web-interfaced, array-based first course in mathematics 
provides a rather different approach to the introduction of calculus. 
Because it is numerically based, the course largely avoids classical 
notation and lends itself rather well to distribution over the Internet. 
Linking the computations done in the course activities with classical 
notation is left to printed materials. We will briefly outline the numerical 
approach to the teaching of calculus, and describe how the program is 
delivered over the Web.",

ABSTRACT="APL is used in the experimental design of graphic displays to be 
applied in real-time, on-line education. These graphic displays are to be 
integrated in instructional dialogs. Our aim is to discover displays that 
will motivate students while they take computer-mediated and distance 
learning courses. During the learning process, it is especially important 
for a student to receive feedback about his/her progress, continually and 
within a few tens of seconds of the most recent interaction. This feedback 
may indicate student performance relative to the recent past and also 
relative to their peers  who have interacted with the same learning items. 
Compact and easy-to-interpret graphical or quantitative (partly numeric) 
displays of student progress are designed as character arrays. The rules for 
constructing these arrays are described conveniently in APL functions. Such 
functions specify a template for each display and establish design 
correctness. The functions also allow flexible testing that reveals how easy 
it is to understand each display.",

EDITOR="Sergio Picchi and Marco Micocci",
ABSTRACT="Many optimization methods are iterative in nature and require 
users to specify constraints and objectives. The normal way to handle this 
type of problem would be to create a loop with an execute statement inside 
the body of the loop. The loop is necessary because of the iterative nature 
of the algorithm and the execute statement is necessary because the 
objective function is user-defined. {\em Execute} can be costly within 
a loop. While there are existing ways to remove execute from the loop, they 
are awkward. However, dynamic functions can be built ahead of time and 
called within the loop. Defined operators allow an arbitrary optimization 
function to be passed to the looping function. The method of simulated 
annealing can deal with large-scale optimization problems without getting 
trapped in local minima. Constraints can be treated as objectives with a
high penalty for violations. Hence, we can eliminate constraints and deal 
only with objectives. A series of objectives is combined into a single 
objective function. Since the objectives are defined by the user, a dynamic 
function is created. The goal is to reduce the result of the dynamic 
function to zero (negative values are not permitted). The function is called 
iteratively until a specific tolerance is reached. This paper will use an 
example from the mortgage industry to demonstrate the use of dynamic 
functions in iterative optimization methods.",

ABSTRACT="Often in these last times the industries ask the mathematicians to 
determine their `true' utility functions directly from the available data 
about the used resources and about the corresponding profits in order to 
optimize the latter with respect to the former. The possibility to determine 
the utility function directly from the data is very important because in 
this way the exact situation of the company is described. Moreover, the 
biggest companies divide their investments in several activities and the 
optimization of their utility function can lead to problems that involve 
separable or partitionable functions. The 2-layered feed-forward neural 
networks are able to approximate any separable function while fitting the 
data maintaining the separable structure with the desired approximation 
error. Thus the theory of the partitionable variational inequalities can be 
used in order to find the optimum of the utility function subjected to some 
constraints. The presence of the partitionable structure is important 
because it simplifies the resolution algorithms and makes them more 
efficient. Moreover, under stronger assumptions on the function, the above 
results can be generalized to a large class of utility functions: one 
problem of dimension $n$ can be split into $n$ problems of dimension 1.",

  abstract =     "This paper expands the specification of a set of
                 kernel routines for linear algebra, historically called
                 the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms and commonly known
                 as the BLAS.\par

                 Numerical linear algebra, particularly the solution of
                 linear systems of equations, linear least squares
                 problems, eigenvalue problems and singular value
                 problems, is fundamental to most calculations in
                 scientific computing, and is often the computationally
                 intense part of such calculations. Designers of
                 computer programs involving linear algebraic operations
                 have frequently chosen to implement certain low level
                 operations, such as the dot product or the matrix
                 vector product, as separate subprograms. This may be
                 observed both in many published codes and in codes
                 written for specific applications at many computer
                 installations.\par

                 A major aim of the standards defined in this paper is
                 to enable linear algebra libraries (both public domain
                 and commercial) to interoperate efficiently, reliably
                 and easily.",

	       languages based on functional programming focuses on such
	       languages as Sisal, Haskell, EPL, Id, Crystal, PTRAN. The
	       contributors, several of whom are directly involved with these
	       projects, discuss such issues as semantics, exposition of
	       parallelism, optimization, implementation, and application. They
	       also evaluate the impact each language can have on the efficient
	       development of parallel software. Rather than forming a
	       programming manual, the chapters describe the general style of
	       programming in each language and use sample programs to
	       illustrate different programming styles.  },

  CONTENTS = {In functional languages intermediate data structures are often used as
              ``glue'' to connect separate parts of a program together. Deforestation
              is the process of automatically removing intermediate data structures.
              In this thesis we present and analyse a new approach to deforestation.
              This new approach is both practical and general. We analyse in detail
              the problem of list removal rather than the more general problem of
              arbitrary data structure removal. This more limited scope allows a
              complete evaluation of the pragmatic aspects of using our deforestation
              technology. We have implemented our list deforestation algorithm in the
              Glasgow Haskell compiler. Our implementation has allowed practical feedback.
              One important conclusion is that a new analysis is required to infer
              function arities and the linearity of lambda abstractions. This analysis
              renders the basic deforestation algorithm far more effective. We give a
              detailed assessment of our implementation of deforestation. We measure
              the effectiveness of our deforestation on a suite of real application
              programs. We also observe the costs of our deforestation algorithm. },

                 of I/O in fp are introduced: Streams (Dialoges), CPS and
                 so called systems, where an (input-) state of the system
                 is mapped into a list of (output-) states, each of which
                 consists of a response and a new state.
                 After a brief (!) discussion of nondeterminism and fp an
                 extended description of I/O in haskell is presented.
                 Nondeterminism is proposed as "gue with which programs
                 are put together", leaving the programms themselves referentially
                 transparent.} ,

  ABSTRACT  = {We give an in-depth introduction to the design of our functional array programming language SaC, the main aspects of its compilation into host machine code, and its parallelisation based on multi-threading. The language design of SaC aims at combining high-level, compositional array programming with fully automatic resource management for highly productive code development and maintenance. We outline the compilation process that maps SaC programs to computing machinery. Here, our focus is on optimisation techniques that aim at restructuring entire applications from nested compositions of general fine-grained operations into specialised coarse-grained operations. We present our implicit parallelisation technology for shared memory architectures based on multi-threading and discuss further optimisation opportunities on this level of code generation. Both optimisation and parallelisation rigorously exploit the absence of side-effects and the explicit data flow characteristic of a functional setting.},

	       languages based on functional programming focuses on such
	       languages as Sisal, Haskell, EPL, Id, Crystal, PTRAN. The
	       contributors, several of whom are directly involved with these
	       projects, discuss such issues as semantics, exposition of
	       parallelism, optimization, implementation, and application. They
	       also evaluate the impact each language can have on the efficient
	       development of parallel software. Rather than forming a
	       programming manual, the chapters describe the general style of
	       programming in each language and use sample programs to
	       illustrate different programming styles.  },

  CONTENTS = {In functional languages intermediate data structures are often used as
              ``glue'' to connect separate parts of a program together. Deforestation
              is the process of automatically removing intermediate data structures.
              In this thesis we present and analyse a new approach to deforestation.
              This new approach is both practical and general. We analyse in detail
              the problem of list removal rather than the more general problem of
              arbitrary data structure removal. This more limited scope allows a
              complete evaluation of the pragmatic aspects of using our deforestation
              technology. We have implemented our list deforestation algorithm in the
              Glasgow Haskell compiler. Our implementation has allowed practical feedback.
              One important conclusion is that a new analysis is required to infer
              function arities and the linearity of lambda abstractions. This analysis
              renders the basic deforestation algorithm far more effective. We give a
              detailed assessment of our implementation of deforestation. We measure
              the effectiveness of our deforestation on a suite of real application
              programs. We also observe the costs of our deforestation algorithm. },

  CONTENTS    = {This paper deals with I/O and nondeterminism. Three kinds
                 of I/O in fp are introduced: Streams (Dialoges), CPS and
                 so called systems, where an (input-) state of the system
                 is mapped into a list of (output-) states, each of which
                 consists of a response and a new state.
                 After a brief (!) discussion of nondeterminism and fp an
                 extended description of I/O in haskell is presented.
                 Nondeterminism is proposed as "gue with which programs
                 are put together", leaving the programms themselves referentially
                 transparent.} ,

abstract = {SMT stands for Satisﬁability ModuloTheories. An SMT solver 
decides the satisﬁability of propositionally complex formulas in 
theories such as arithmetic and uninterpreted functions with equality. 
SMT solving has numerous applications in automated theorem proving, 
in hardware and software veriﬁcation, and in scheduling and 
planning problems. 
This paper describes Yices, an efﬁcient SMT solver 
developed at SRIInternational. 
Yices supports a rich combination of ﬁrst-order theories 
that occur frequently in software and hardware modeling: 
arithmetic, uninterpreted functions, bit vectors, arrays, 
recursive datatypes, and more. 
Beyond pure SMT solving, Yices can solve weighted MAX-SMT problems, 
compute unsatisﬁable cores, and construct models. 
Yices is the main decision procedure used by the SAL model checking 
environment, and it is being integrated to the PVS 
theorem prover. As a MAX-SMT solver, 
Yices is the main component of the probabilistic consistency engine 
used in SRI's CALO system.},
