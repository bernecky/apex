Computation on large Boolean arrays is becoming more prevalent,
due to applications such as cryptography, data compression, and image
analysis and synthesis.
The advent of bit-oriented vector
extensions for microprocessors and of GPUS presents opportunities for 
significant performance improvements in such Boolean-dominated applications.
Since APL is one of the few computer languages that supports 
dense (one bit per element, eight bits per byte), multi-dimensional Boolean 
arrays as first-class objects, it has naturally attracted
research into optimizations for improved performance of
Boolean array operations.
This paper presents some of the 
Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) Boolean-related optimizations that have
appeared in APL implementations, and suggests ways in which those optimizations
might be exploited using contemporary hardware.
