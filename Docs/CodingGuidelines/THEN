Coding Style for APEX, Then

The only coding guidelines for APEX back in The Dark Ages
were to make it comprehensible by humans, and to
operate inside a tiny workspace on system that
probably had 384KB of DRAM, decades before there were Dfns or
APL control structures such as :FOR.

Experimental design changes, such as the representation of
conjunctions and adverbs in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST),
were just that: experiments, rarely carried through to completion
as would be done for a production system. I was the only
customer, so this was okay. Then.

There was no git or svn at the time. I had written
APE (The APL Program Editor), for maintaining SHARP APL
source code (mostly S/370 Assembler Code) for IPSA,
but it was not really suitable for use on a tiny PC
with a tinier (20MB) hard drive. 

In 1970, when I built the first Snake Island Research Inc
development system, I bought a 1GB SCSI hard
drive, for the princely sum of $4500USD.
