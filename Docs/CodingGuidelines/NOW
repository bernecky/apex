Coding Style for APEX, Now

Some general thoughts on coding style for
new work on APEX:

1. Try to write code that does not use
   control structures. E.g., avoid :IF, :FOR, etc.
   This means that each function you write
   should, when feasible, be an APL basic block.

2. Do not use error trapping. Ever.

3. Try to write functions as Dfns. I find them to be
   easier to maintain. They are likely to
   be more compilable, should we get to the
   point of making APEX compile itself.

4. Avoid oddball (object-oriented) rubbish and
   weird language constructs.

5. Aaron Hsu likes to promote the use of the Dyalog APL "key" operator:

   I don't have any immediate wonderful ideas on how
   it would make APEX simpler, better, cleaner, etc., 
   but welcome same.
